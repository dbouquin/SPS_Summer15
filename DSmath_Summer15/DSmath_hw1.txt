2.12
School absences. Data collected at elementary schools in DeKalb County, GA suggest
that each year roughly 25% of students miss exactly one day of school, 15% miss 2 days, and 28%
miss 3 or more days due to sickness.

(a) What is the probability that a student chosen at random doesn’t miss any days of school due
to sickness this year?
(25 + 15 + 28) = 68 ; 100 - 68 = 32 ; 32%

(b) What is the probability that a student chosen at random misses no more than one day?
25%

(c) What is the probability that a student chosen at random misses at least one day?
68%

(d) If a parent has two kids at a DeKalb County elementary school, what is the probability that
neither kid will miss any school? Note any assumption you must make to answer this question.
32/100 * 32/100 = .1024
This assumes the two children getting sick (events) are independent

(e) If a parent has two kids at a DeKalb County elementary school, what is the probability that
that both kids will miss some school, i.e. at least one day? Note any assumption you make.
68/100 * 68/100 = .4624
This assumes the two children getting sick (events) are independent

(f) If you made an assumption in part (d) or (e), do you think it was reasonable? If you didn’t
make any assumptions, double check your earlier answers.
This is somewhat reasonable. By assuming a child getting sick is independent of whether or not
the other child in the family gets sick, you assume the family is keeping them apart and taking
preventative measures with the not sick child. You may want to calculate the likelihood that one
child being sick increases the likelihood that the other child gets sick.

2.14
Weight and health coverage, Part I. The Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System
(BRFSS) is an annual telephone survey designed to identify risk factors in the adult population and
report emerging health trends. The following table summarizes two variables for the respondents:
weight status using body mass index (BMI) and health coverage, which describes whether each
respondent had health insurance.66

Weight Status
                 |  Not Overweight | Overweight |Obese    | Total
                 |   or obese      |            |         |
Health   |  Yes  | 134,801         | 141,699    | 107,301 | 383,801
Coverage |  No   | 15,098          | 15,327     | 14,412  | 44,837
         | Total | 149,899         | 157,026    | 121,713 | 428,638

(a) If we draw one individual at random, what is the probability that the respondent is overweight
and doesn’t have health coverage?
15327/428638 = .0358

(b) If we draw one individual at random, what is the probability that the respondent is overweight
or doesn’t have health coverage?
P(overweight OR no coverage) = P(overweight) + P(no coverage) - P(overweight and no coverage)
                             = (157026/428638) + (44837/328638) - (15327/428638)
                             = .36633709563 + .13653279231 - .03575744567
                             = .467

2.28
Socks in a drawer. In your sock drawer you have 4 blue, 5 gray, and 3 black socks. Half
asleep one morning you grab 2 socks at random and put them on. Find the probability you end
up wearing

(a) 2 blue socks
4/12 * 3/11 = .0909

(b) no gray socks
7/12 * 6/11 = .318

(c) at least 1 black sock

1 - P(no black)
1 - ((9/12) * (8/11))
1 - .5454
= .45

OR

Binomial coefficients
n!/(k!(n-k)!)

2!/(1!(1-2)!) = 2
2!/(2!(2-2)!) = 1

P(r = 1) = 2 * (3/12)^1 * (9/12)^(2-1) = 2 * (3/12) * (9/12) = .375
           1

P(r = 2) = 2 * (3/12)^2 * (9/12)^(2-2) = 1 * (.0625) * 1 = .065
           2

         = .375 + .065 = .45

(d) a green sock
0/12 = 0

(e) matching socks
2 blue OR 2 gray OR 2 black
P (A U B U C) = P(A) + P(B) + P(C) - P(A ∩ B) - P(A ∩ C) - P(B ∩ C) + P(A ∩ B ∩ C)

A = P(2 blue) = 4/12 * 3/11 = .0909
B = P(2 gray) = 5/12 * 4/11 = .1515
C = P(2 black) = 3/12 * 2/11 = .04545

= .0909 + .1515 + .04545 - (.0909 * .1515) - (.0909 * .04545) - (.1515 * .04545) + (.0909 * .1515 * .04545)
= .2637

Books on a bookshelf. The table below shows the distribution of books on a bookcase
based on whether they are nonfiction or fiction and hardcover or paperback.

Format
                   | Hardcover | Paperback |Total
     |  Fiction    | 13        | 59        | 72
Type |  Nonfiction | 15        | 8         | 23
     | Total       | 28        | 67        | 95

(a) Find the probability of drawing a hardcover book first then a paperback fiction book second
when drawing without replacement.
(28/95) * (59/94) = .185

(b) Determine the probability of drawing a fiction book first and then a hardcover book second,
when drawing without replacement.

(72/95) * (28/94) = .2258

(c) Calculate the probability of the scenario in part (b), except this time complete the calculations
under the scenario where the first book is placed back on the bookcase before randomly drawing
the second book.
(72/95) * (28/95) = .2234

(d) The final answers to parts (b) and (c) are very similar. Explain why this is the case.
They are similar because there is a probability that the fiction book is hardcover, and it therefore impacts
the probability that the second draw is a hardcover book.
